# Text-Sorter

An academic project which I completed in my first computer science course.  This simple program counts the characters or words, or alphabetically indexes the words contained in a .txt file.  Additionally, it can create, write, modify, save and copy .txt files.

When developing this program I improved my skills in basic error handling, text manipulation, as well as the use of fstream and general file manipulation.  This repository is included to show the history of my development as a programmer.

As an academic project, this repository contains a small amount of code which was provided and required by the professor teaching the course.
